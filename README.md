# Quickstart

You need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) already installed in your
computer. If you don't have it, follow
[these](https://golang.org/doc/install) instructions for your
distribution. You can also compile it from source. If you already have
it, move to the next paragraph.

Installing Drawer itself is pretty easy. Simply run: 

`go install github.com/endi1/drawer`
